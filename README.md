Bug Fix
Buttons not reenabling after being disabled making quiz defunct.

Original code in showAnswer () - 
    // Disable buttons so player cannot choose another
    answerButtons.forEach(btn => btn.disabled = true);

Realised that the quiz required a further function to reset the quiz after each button was clicked 

New code in showQuestion () - 
// Enable button on each individual question
    answerButtons.forEach(btn => btn = false);

    Quiz continued to not work despite putting in code to reset buttons on every question. Used Google debugger to work out that I was missing the button object so code could not reset. 

New code V2 in showQuestion () -   
// Enable button on each individual question
    answerButtons.forEach(btn => btn.disabled = false);

    Code now works and resets buttons on every question
